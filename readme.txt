DESCRIPTION:

This is my personal portfolio website built using the HUDSON template from StyleShout.  
I customized the design and content to showcase my work as a video editor, motion graphics 
designer, and digital creative professional. My goal is to present a clean, modern, and 
professional online presence where clients can explore my projects, skills, and experience.
